## **Lab Activity 1.3**

## **Labeling Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

- Obtain labeling tape and one of the models or skeletons ( e.g., a torso model, mini muscle person torso, skeleton)
- Write the directional terms from activity 1.2 on the model.
- Once you are done, have another group check your accuracy. Make corrections if needed.
- Then, have your instructor or Lab Instructor check your accuracy.
- Take pictures of your work to use as a study guide.

## **Applying Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

Use appropriate anatomical and regional terminology to fill in the blanks in the statements below.

| 1. | The elbow is located to the wrist.                                   |  |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| 2. | The umbilicus is located to the sternum.                             |  |
| 3. | The nose is located and                                              |  |
|    | to the ears.                                                         |  |
| 4. | The mouth is located to the chin.                                    |  |
| 5. | A papercut that does not penetrate the skin would be considered as a |  |
|    | wound; however, a puncture wound from a                              |  |
|    | nail penetrating the skin would be considered as a                   |  |
|    | wound.                                                               |  |
| 6. | A wound on the elbow would be to the elbow.                          |  |

## **Lab Activity 1.5**

## **Applying Anatomical and Regional Terminology**

Next, using the definition of anatomical position and correct anatomical language, take turns with your lab partner to give simple, one-movement verbal instructions to transition from the given starting positions (listed in the table below), so that the other person ends up in anatomical position. Write your detailed step-by-step instructions on the provided table.

## **Chapter 2: Use of the Microscope**

## **Objectives**

In this laboratory session you will learn to use an essential tool in the biologist's kit, the compound light microscope. Carefully read and closely follow the following instructions before you begin this activity in order to avoid damaging the microscope in your care.

## **Your objectives for this lab are:**

- Identify the parts of the microscope and list the function of each.
- Demonstrate the proper techniques for use, care, and transportation of the microscope.
- Define and demonstrate a working understanding of the concepts of total magnification, resolution, parfocal, field diameter, depth of field, and working distance.
- Apply microscopy skills to properly focus, view, and manipulate a variety of histology slides.
- Explain why the microscope's field of view decreases as you increase the magnification.

### **Terms to Learn:**

- Arm
- Neck
- Body
- Base
- Ocular lens
- Objective lens
- Rotating nosepiece or Turret

- Course and Fine focus knobs
- Mechanical stage
- Mechanical stage knobs
- Illumination light source
- Iris diaphragm
- Condenser adjustment knob

### **General Rules:**

- Always carry the microscope using two hands. The easiest way to do this is to place one hand holding the arm while the other hand is supporting the base.
- Do not touch the objective lenses. The lenses should originally be set in the scan position and when stored the microscope scanning lens should be set in place.
- If needed, the ocular and objective lenses must be cleaned with a special lens paper and lens cleaning solution.
- Report any malfunctions of the microscope to your instructor, do not attempt to repair the scope yourself.

#### **Returning the Microscope to the Cabinet.**

- Lower the stage.
- Rotate the turret so that the scanning (4x) lens is in position over the stage.
- Remove the lens from the stage and clean the lens before replacing it in its storage box.
- Secure the cord by wrapping it around the correct holder on the back of the microscope.
- Replace the dust cover.
- Carry the microscope back to the storage cabinet with **two hands!**

## **Lab Activities**

## **Magnification**

Student scopes used in our classes have four objective lenses (i.e., those that are closest to the specimen); scanning, low power high power and oil immersion. The set of lenses closest to the eye are the ocular lenses.

## **General Procedures**

## **Microscope components**

- Go to the storage cabinet and obtain a microscope, with two hands bring the microscope back to your workbench. Clear off the work bench so that you have plenty of room to use the microscope and take notes.
- Also, obtain the following slides to use later in this lab.
  - o A slide containing a metric ruler glued to it,
  - o The letter "e,"
  - o A slide of three crossed colored threads
- Clean the ocular and objective lenses and reset the turret so that the scanning lens is in position.
- Plug the microscope into the plug on your workbench.
- Identify the parts of the microscope and label them with labeling tape.

Record the magnifications of the lenses on your microscope in the table below.

| Lenses          | Ocular | Objective | Total         |
|-----------------|--------|-----------|---------------|
|                 | Lens   | lens      | Magnification |
| Scanning        |        |           |               |
| Red lines       |        |           |               |
| Low power: dry  |        |           |               |
| Blue lines      |        |           |               |
| High Power: dry |        |           |               |
| Yellow lines    |        |           |               |
| Oil Immersion:  |        |           |               |
| oil             |        |           |               |
| Black/white     |        |           |               |
| lines           |        |           |               |

To determine the total magnification simply multiply the ocular lens magnification by the objective lens magnification. For example, if the Ocular lens magnification is 10X and the scanning lens magnification is 4X then the total magnification will be 40X. Complete the table above.

## **Focusing on Specimens**

For biology 109 labs you will only be focusing on a total magnification of 400x. You will be required to use the oil immersion lenses (1000x) in your Introduction to Biology (110) and Microbiology (230) classes. For your first practical you will have to focus on a specimen at a total magnification of 400x. You will have two minutes to complete this task.

Focusing on a specimen may be broken down into a three-step process.

#### **1. Scanning Lens (4x):**

- Begin focusing on a specimen using the Scanning lens. First, adjust the mechanical stage so that it is at its lowest position. You can do this by turning the course focus knobs away from your body.
- Turn on the light. And adjust the ocular lenses so that your field of view is a circle of light.
- Place and center the specimen on the mechanical stage.
- Look into the oculars and slowly raise the mechanical stage by turning the course focus knob towards your body. Stop when it comes into focus. You may adjust the focus using the fine focus knob that is needed.
- Center the specimen. Adjust the X-Y stage knobs so that your specimen is in the center of your field of view. This position will enable you to see the specimen when you adjust the lens to the next higher magnification. If the specimen is

found to the side, then you may lose the specimen from your field of view when you adjust your objective lens to the next higher magnification.

#### **2. Low Power (10x)**

- Next while looking into your objective lenses turn the turret clockwise (to the right) to 10x power.
- Adjust the focus. Do not use the course focus knob to adjust your focus. Only use the fine focus knob at this point. If you use the course focus knob, then you may adjust your focus too far out of focus and may have to start at the Scanning power again.
- Center your specimen

#### **3. High Power (40X)**

- Finally, switch to the high-power lens (40X) by turning the lens to the right (clockwise). At this point only use the fine focus to adjust the focus.
- If the color of light is too yellow, you may adjust the rheostat to change the color of light to t white light.
- If the light is too dark, you may adjust the diaphragm.

## **Measuring and Calculating the Field of View**

The field of view is the area of the area of the specimen you can see through the ocular lenses. When you adjust your magnification, the diameter will decrease at higher magnifications. The image below, figure 2.3, is an example of a field of view.

How to determine the field of view:

- Obtain a prepared slide that has a ruler and place it onto the stage.
- Adjust the ruler so that the edge of the ruler is visible as a series of tic marks/lines that lie across the diameter or the field of view as in the figure below.

|         | When you use the high-power and oil-immersion lenses you should not be able to<br>measure the field of view directly. At this point you will have to calculate the field of<br>view. This calculation is a simple conversion using the formula below:            |

• Arrange the slide so that the horizontal line is aligned along the midline of the field as

- Depth of field: examination of different colored threads
  - o Obtain a slide of three crossed threads.
  - o Place the slide onto the stage and with the scanning lens, focus on the threads using your fine focus. Decide which thread is on top, middle and the bottom.
  - o Now change your magnification to the 100x low-power lens. Find the top thread and focus on the bottom thread. Do you have to move the adjustment knob more or less than you did with the scanning lens?

| o | Finally change your objective lens to the 400x<br>high-power lens. With this  |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   | magnification each thread may take up the entire field of view. Is the entire |
|   | thickness of the thread in focus as it was under the scanning lens?           |

|   | the high-power lens?                                                          |

#### • Examining tissues

- o Your instructor will direct you to observe a series of tissue slides to practice your technique.
- o Practice viewing the slides at a total magnification of 40X, 100X and 400X.

### **End of Lab**

- Clean off the slides you used and return them back to their proper storage trays.
- Turn off your microscope, unplug your microscope and wrap the cord around its holder or base.
- Rotate the lenses so that the scanning lens is in the viewing position.
- Lower the microscope stage to its lowest position.
- If available put the dustcover over the microscope.
- Return the microscope back to its proper storage cabinet.

### **Troubleshooting**

- 1. The image is too dark!
  - a. Make sure the microscope is plugged in.
  - b. Make sure that the plug is functioning.
  - c. Make sure your light is on.
  - d. Make sure that the dimming rheostat is turned up and not on off.
  - e. Adjust the diaphragm,
  - f. Adjust your rheostat for a whiter light.
- 2. I cannot use both eyes to view the slide, or I must close one eye to use the microscope.
  - a. Move your head back from the oculars you may be too close.
  - b. Adjust the oculars either closer together or apart until you see a single image in the microscope.

- 3. There is a spot in my viewing field- even when I move the slide the spot stays in the same place!
  - a. Your lens is dirty. Use lens paper to clean the objective and ocular lenses. The ocular lens can be removed to clean the inside. Only use lens paper because a cotton shirt or regular paper may scratch the lens coating.
- 4. I cannot see anything under high power!
  - a. Remember the steps,
    - i. If you cannot focus under scanning and then low power, you will not be able to focus anything under high power.
    - ii. Remember to center the specimen in the middle of the field of view before switching to a higher power.
- 5. Only half of my viewing field is lit, it looks like there is a half-moon in there!
  - a. You do not have your objective fully clicked into place.
  - b. Adjust the condenser.
- 6. I see my eyelashes!
  - a. You are too close to the objective, so move your head back a little.
- 7. I cannot get a clear image of my specimen.
  - a. Make sure that the slide is not flipped upside-down on the stage.
- 8. This gives me a headache!
  - a. Try adjusting your focus on your right first then adjust the focus on your left eye to adjust for any focal differences between the two eyes,
  - b. Try adjusting the ocular distance,
  - c. Check that the intensity of your light is not too high or too low.
  - d. Finally, take a break when needed!

## **Lab Activities**

### **Lab Activity 4.1**

## **Epithelial Tissues: Classification of the Epithelial Tissues**

Epithelial tissues are classified by a) the number of layers of cells in the tissue and b) the shape of the cells within the tissue. A single layer of cells is defined as a simple layer whereas a tissue of multiple layers is called stratified. The name of the stratified tissue is based on the type of cells that are found in the apical surface. A pseudostratified tissue consists of a single layer of irregularly shaped cells. This construction led to the appearance that the tissue consisted of more than one layer.

The shape of the cells in a single layer is indicative of the function of the cells. Cells that have a flattened shape are squamous type cells. Simple squamous tissue if located in those organs whose function is to allow easy passage of molecules or compounds through the cell (e. g., alveolar tissue in the lung, and the lining of kidney tubules). Simple cuboidal cells look box-like and are associated with those tissues that are active in absorption and secretion. Finally, columnar cells are taller than they are wide.; their nucleus is usually located next to the basilar surface of the cell. These cells are also active in secretion and absorption of molecules.

## **Epidermis**

The epidermis consists of stratified epithelial tissue which is primarily composed of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes produce the protein keratin which waterproofs the cells as well as provides additional strength and protection. Other cells found within this layer are the melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin and the Langerhans cells that provide an immune function.

Epidermal Layers: the layers or strata progression from the superficial to the deep layers.

## **Characteristics of this Layer:**

- Mostly keratinocytes
- reproductive actively mitotic division
- produce keratin with cell progression upward keratinization.

### **Strata of the Epidermis:**

- superficial stratum stratum corneum
- intermediate stratum
  - o stratum lucidum absent in "thin" skin.

**Figure 5.16 The Integumentary System**

## **Across**

- **7** the layer which serves to strengthen the skin and provides our skin with elasticity. It contains hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. (9,5)
- **8** a thin layer of cells in the epidermis lying above the stratum spinosum and below the stratum corneum. (7,10)
- **9** the outermost of the three layers that comprise the skin (9)

### **Down**

**1** the outermost layer of the epidermis comprised of several levels of flattened corneocytes (7,7)

- **2** a more superficial and significantly thinner layer of the dermis, mainly composed of areolar connective tissue. (9,5)
- **3** the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrates. (10)
- **4** a layer of the epidermis composed of polyhedral keratinocytes. (7,8)
- **5** the deepest layer of the five layers of the epidermis, the external covering of skin in mammals. The stratum. It is a single layer of columnar or cuboidal basal cells (7,6)
- **6** a thin, clear layer of dead skin cells in the epidermis named for its translucent appearance only in areas of thick skin (7,7)

## **Check Your Understanding**

- You are a medical examiner (ME) who is performing an autopsy on a shooting victim. The bullet did not pass through the body and was lodged in the abdomen near the spine. The ME must find and retrieve the bullet to determine its caliber, so she needs to cut through the integument. List the layers that you would cut through from the superficial to the deepest layer.
- It is late in the summer and a young couple that had planted a garden began to freeze and can produce their products for use later in the year. Their garden was very productive, so they were able to store carrots, corn, sweet potatoes, spinach, butternut squash, broccoli, and cantaloupe for use in the winter. They have a four-month-old daughter, and they noticed that after they began feeding her some of the canned food her skin developed a yellowishorange tint. They immediately took her to the general practitioner (GP), and he checked out the child. Following the examination, he returned the child to the parents and with a smirk and gleam in his eyes he indicated that the child was fine but cautioned them that they should vary her diet. Explain why the GP is not concerned about the child's skin condition?

• Discuss how the Integumentary system's skin helps to regulate your body temperature, when your body temperature rises above normal.

## **Organization of the Skeletal System**

## **Overview of the Whole Skeletal System**

The skeletal system can be divided into two divisions, the axial and the appendicular divisions. The axial skeleton forms the main axis of the body. It includes the skull, the vertebral column, and the rib cage (see Figure 7.6). The appendicular skeleton consists of all of the bones of the limbs , including the girdles.

## **The Skull**

Activity: In this exercise the objective is to do the following:

- List and identify the cranial and facial bones.
- Locate the major suture lines of the skull and name the bones associated with each.
- Define the paranasal sinuses and identify the location of each.
- Name the bones that make up the walls of the orbit and identify the openings associated with the orbit.
- Identify the bones and structures that form the nasal septum and nasal conchae and locate the hyoid bone.
- Identify the bony openings and markings of the skull.

## **Lab Activity 10.1**

Compare and contrast the three muscle tissue types: Skeletal muscle, Smooth muscle, and Cardiac muscle.

- Working in groups of two get a microscope from the storage cabinet and a slide of the skeletal, cardiac and muscle cells.
- Focus on the slide and once you have found the images on the slides provided in the lab, increase your magnification to 400x. Find a section where you can clearly identify the unique structural features described in the background information of your textbook. Draw and label the microscopic structures of all each of the three muscle tissue types in the spaces provided.
- Next take a picture with your cellphone. Upload the screenshot into a PPT folder and label the parts of each muscle tissue.
- Draw and label the three types of muscle cells in the table below.

**Figure 11.27** Head and Neck Actions.

|  | Across |  |
|--|--------|--|
|--|--------|--|

**3** The direction of a muscle's pull is determined by the direction of the \_\_\_\_\_. (6) **5** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the mouth down,

tensing the skin of the neck. (8)

- **9** The \_\_\_\_\_ is the prime mover in jaw elevation: it pulls the ramus of the mandible toward the zygomatic arch. (8)
- **10** The \_\_\_\_\_ muscles (one on each side) pull the mastoid process of the skull toward the sternum and clavicle. When both contract together, they flex the neck. (19)
- **11** To purse the lips when we want to kiss or whistle, we contract the \_\_\_\_\_. (11,4)

- **1** The prime mover for inspiration (breathing in) is the \_\_\_\_\_, which presses into the abdominal cavity, expanding the thoracic cavity as it does. (9)
- **2** One winks, blinks, or squints by contracting the \_\_\_\_\_. (11,5)
- **4** To widen the mouth, or compress puffed cheeks, we contract the \_\_\_\_\_. (10)
- **6** (True/False) A muscle cannot lengthen itself. (4)
- **7** The corners of the mouth are raised during a smile by the \_\_\_\_\_ (11)
- **8** The \_\_\_\_\_ raises the eyebrows. (9)

**Figure 11.28** Thoracic Muscles.

## **3** For abduction beyond horizontal (to bring arm above head) the \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ must raise and rotate the scapula, so that the glenoid cavity faces upward. (9,8,8)

- **5** The \_\_\_\_ is used to flex the shoulder from the adducted position by pulling the humerus upward, toward the clavicle. (7)
- **6** The \_\_\_\_\_ extends the shoulder by pulling the intertubercular groove of the humerus toward the vertebral column. (10,5)

- **1** The \_\_\_\_\_, a pair of segmented muscles, pulls the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of the ribs toward the pubic crest and symphysis, thereby flexing the lumbar vertebrae. (6,9)
- **2** Contracting the \_\_\_\_ on one side results in head rotation. (19)
- **4** The \_\_\_\_\_ flexes the shoulder from the abducted position by pulling the intertubercular groove of the humerus toward the sternum. (10,5)

**Figure 11.29** Shoulder and Upper Limb.

- **4** The glenoid cavity is so shallow and the range of motion so great that the shoulder is held together primarily by the tendons of the muscles that surround it. The four muscles whose tendons contribute the most stability are together called the \_\_\_\_\_. (7,4)
- **5** Flexors are on the \_\_\_\_\_ of the forearm. (8)
- **6** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the radial tuberosity of the radius toward the shoulder, flexing the elbow (6,7)
- **7** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the posterior surfaces of several bones of the hand toward the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, resulting in both finger and wrist extension. (8,9)

- **1** Extensors are on the \_\_\_\_\_ of the forearm. (9)
- **2** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the coronoid process of the ulna toward the humerus, thus flexing the elbow. (10)
- **3** The \_\_\_\_ extends the forearm by pulling the olecranon process toward the superior, posterior shaft of the humerus and toward the scapula. (7,7)

**Figure 11.30** Muscles: Hip and Leg.

## **Across 4** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the medial surface of the tibia toward the pubis, thus adducting the thigh. (8)

- **5** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the greater trochanter of the femur toward the iliac crest, abducting the thigh. (7,6)
- **7** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the femur toward the dorsal ilium, sacrum, and coccyx, extending the hip. (7,7)
- **8** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the tibial tuberosity toward the ilium, extending the knee (6,7)
- **9** The \_\_\_\_\_ pull the fibula and tibia toward the ischial tuberosity of the Os coxa; with the knee locked, this extends the hip. (10)

- **1** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the femur toward the iliac crest, sacrum, and lumbar vertebrae, thus flexing the hip. (9)
- **2** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the foot toward the lateral tibial condyle and proximal tibia, dorsiflexing the ankle. (8,8)
- **3** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the calcaneus toward the distal end of the femur, plantar flexing the ankle. It is most powerful when the knee is straight. (13)
- **6** The \_\_\_\_\_ pulls the calcaneus toward the proximal ends of the tibia and fibula, plantar flexing the ankle. (6)

## **Activity 13.7: Dissection of the Sheep or Pig Brains**

The objective of this activity is to carefully dissect a sheep brain and to locate and identify the structures noted in the list above. You will form teams of two to three. Obtain the following materials from the staging area on the side of the lab: dissection tray, brain, set of dissection tools, dissection pins and some tape for labeling the parts following the dissection.

**Note: This is a gloves and goggles lab so everyone must be wearing gloves and goggles during the dissection.**

*Read the following steps carefully before you begin.* 

1. Place the sheep's brain in the tray with the dorsal side on the top as noted in Fig 13.28 . The brains may have a thick tough membrane covering the entire structure. This is the dura mater. You need to carefully remove this covering using your scissors. You need to carefully cut around the cerebellum, pituitary gland, or optic nerve so you do not remove these structures. Your instructor will demonstrate the procedure.

![](_page_350_Picture_24.jpeg)

**Figure 13.27** Dissected Sheep Brain.

2. After the dura mater is removed, you can identify the cerebrum and its longitudinal fissure separating the left and right cerebral hemispheres as well as the cerebellum.

![](_page_351_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 13.28** Sheep Brain (Opening the Longitudinal Fissure).

3. Reposition the brain so that the ventral side is facing you (Fig 13.30). Identify the cerebellum, optic chiasma, optic nerves. If it is still attached locate the pituitary gland.

![](_page_351_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 13.29** Cranial Nerves of the Sheep.

4. Reposition the brain back to the dorsal side. Locate the longitudinal fissure. Now, with a scalpel gently make a cut through the fissure. This will butterfly the brain into two left and right halves (Fig 13.31). Be sure to cut all the way through the pituitary gland if it is present.

- 6. Compare the structures that you see in your dissection specimen to those in the human brain models.
- 7. Place dissection pins in the brain structures you need to identify from the dissection objectives above. Print the name of the structure on some tape and attach it to the proper pins. Take a picture of the labelled brain for your study guide.
- 8. When you are done observing the pig/sheep brain specimen and have completed the exercise, dispose of it as directed by your instructor. Wash and dry your dissection instruments, pins, and tray. Return these to the staging area. Clean the tables with Lysol and wait for additional directions from your instructor.

## **Cow Eye Dissection Instructions**

## **Materials Needed**

- Goggles and gloves
- Preserved Cow Eye

- Dissecting Kit with Scalpels
- Dissecting tray and paper towels
- 1. Examine the outside of the eye. Locate the **sclera (i.e.,** the whites of the eye). This tough, outer covering of the eyeball has fat and muscle attached to it.
- 2. Locate the covering over the front of the eye, the **cornea**. Because of preservatio0n the cornea should look cloudy; however, when the cow was alive, it was clear.
- 3. Cut away the excess fat and muscle, this may only be necessary if fat is covering the cornea of the eye and is in your way. Fat around the backside of the eye can be left alone. Flip the eye over to find the **optic nerve** where it exits out the back of the eye do not remove this structure. You may have to remove some excess fat and tissue to see it well. It will be stronger and more rope-like than the surrounding fat tissue.

**Figure 14.16** The Cow Eye being Dissected on a Paper Towel.

4. Use a scalpel or scissors to make an incision in the cornea. In this case you want to make a coronal incision, in back of the cornea, so that you will separate the anterior portion of the eye from the posterior end.

Please note, the cornea is tougher than it appears and may require some force to puncture, be careful when using the scalpel. Press the scalpel downwards into the dissecting pan away from you. Once the cornea is broken, clear liquid will leak (or squirt) out – this liquid is the **aqueous humor**.

5. Use a scalpel or scissors to make an incision in the sclera so that you can cut around the outside of the eye. Your goal is to separate the eye into a front and a back half.

**Figure 14.17** Dissected Cow Eye Showing Internal Structures.

- 6. Separate the inner parts of the eye.
  - The gelatinous liquid in the middle of the eye is the **vitreous humor** , which will also contain a hard, sphere-shaped **lens**.
  - Find the cornea (which you punctured in step 1) and then the disk-shaped **iris** behind it.
  - The iris will be dark in color and contain a center opening, the **pupil**.
- 7. The image below shows how each part of the eye appears when it has been separated. Take a photo of your own eye for comparison.

**Figure 14.18** Dissected Cow Eye Internal Structures.

- 8. The posterior section of the eye contains two layers, a very thin layer of cells that is easy to scrape off (and may fall off on its own), which is the **retina**. Behind, the retina is a blue, reflective layer known as the **tapetum** as you can see in the figure above.
- 9. The retina will converge at a point in the eye where it connects with the optic nerve. This is the **optic disk**. It may be easiest to find by scraping off the retina and locating the spot where it remains closely attached. Flipping the eye over will also show how that spot is directly in front of the optic nerve.
- 10. Label the Cow Eye (use your text of the descriptions above). Take a picture of the labeled eye to keep as a reference.

### **Hormones of the Adrenal Glands**

- Adrenal cortex (releases corticosteroid hormones)
  - o Zona glomerulosa: aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) retention of sodium and excretion of potassium (sodium retention increases water and blood volume and blood pressure)
  - o Zona fasciculata: cortisol (glucocorticoid) (hydrocortisone) increases blood glucose, also depresses inflammatory and allergic responses.
  - o Zona reticularis: androgens supplement male hormones
- adrenal medulla 80% epinephrine and 20% norepinephrine (stimulated by sympathetic fibers) - brings about sympathetic effects.

**Figure 15.32** Crossword of the Pituitary.

### **Across**

- **3** Circulating hormones are released into the \_\_\_\_\_ by an endocrine gland and must travel to reach their (often distant) target. (5)
- **4** \_\_\_\_\_ enter the cell and interact directly with DNA and nuclear factors to bring about changes in gene expression. (8)
- **6** Together, the \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ regulate the secretion of virtually every hormone in the body. (12,9)

- **1** \_\_\_\_\_ based hormones are made from an amino acid by chemical modification or made by joining amino acids to form a peptide (very smallx protein). (5,4)
- **2** Steroids, one of the two major hormone classes, are made from \_\_\_\_\_. (11)

## **Sheep Heart Dissection:**

## **Lab Activity 16.6. Sheep heart dissection**

Form groups of three (3) to dissect the sheep heart. Each person will have a specific job during this operation; the surgeon, the assistant and one person documenting the work by taking pictures or drawing diagrams of the procedure.

**Lab safety:** Globes, safety goggles and proper clothing are required. Follow your Instructor's instructions.

### **Equipment needed:**

- Dissecting equipment
  - o Gloves and goggles
  - o Dissection tray
  - o Scalpel
  - o Probes
  - o Scissors
  - o Dissecting pins
  - o Pipe cleaners
  - o Preserved heart.
- 1. The picture below is the anterior view of a preserved sheep's heart. Note that the anterior side has an interventricular sulcus containing the left anterior descending coronary artery embedded within the fat. In this figure, the area to the right of the sulcus is the left side of the heart. If the fibrous pericardium is intact, slit it open with a scalpel or cut it with scissors, then cut it from the attachments. Note how the visceral pericardium differs from the parietal pericardium.

![](_page_456_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Figure 16.13** Sheep Heart Anterior View.

2. Examine the external surface of the heart. Determine which side is superior (broad, with large blood vessels issuing from it) and which side is inferior (the apex is pointed). Locate the pulmonary trunk. This large vessel delivers blood to the lungs from the right side of the heart. It is located in the middle of the anterior side of the heart.

![](_page_457_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 16.14** Anterior Aspect of the Sheep Heart.

- 3. Locate the auricles, the dog-ear-shaped external extensions of the atria on the superior region of the heart. The rest of the heart will be the ventricles. You should be able to distinguish between the right and left ventricles by palpating the heart with your gloved hand. The right ventricle is smaller and thinner-walled and will feel less firm when you squeeze it. You should also be able to feel the interventricular sulcus as well.
- 4. Take your dissecting knife and make a single coronal cut through the ventricle up to the atria /base of the heart. This will divide the heart into anterior and posterior halves. Open the two halves so that you can observe the internal features of the heart.

5. Look at the heart wall. Identify the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium. Identify the left ventricle from the right ventricle. As was noted above, the left ventricle which serves the systemic circulation is thicker than the right ventricle which pumps blood through the pulmonary system.

![](_page_458_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 16.15** Dissected Sheep Heart.

6. Within the interior of the heart identify the AV valves (bicuspid and tricuspid) and their features, including the chordae tendineae and their attachment to the papillary muscles. Within the walls of the ventricles, you should be able to see and feel the trabeculae carneae, or muscular ridges that are distinct from the papillary muscle. The thick interventricular septum between the right and left ventricles should be very evident. Note that the walls of the left ventricle are much thicker than those of the right ventricle. In the atria, you may be able to see and feel the ridges of the pectinate muscles.

![](_page_459_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Figure 16.15** Chordae Tendineae and Papillary Muscles.

- 7. Create or upload a picture of your dissected sheep heart to your computer study guide. On your image, label the right and left ventricles, the right and left atria, the bicuspid and tricuspid valves, the papillary muscles, the chordae tendineae, the interventricular septum, the pulmonary trunk, and the aorta.
- 8. Call your instructor to review and discuss your dissection. Following your review, discard your specimen in the biohazard waste container. Wash and dry your tray and instruments, then clean your bench area.

### **Lab Activity 16.6 Tracing blood flow through the sheep heart.**

• Beginning with a drop of blood in the superior / inferior vena cavae, trace and list the pathway taken by a drop of blood as it travels throughout the heart and the pulmonary system. Include as many heart chambers, structures, great vessels, and valves as you can. You will end at the **Aorta**.

## **Terms**

## **Cardiac Cycle**

• Systole • Diastole

![](_page_460_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 16.17** Cardiac Systole and Diastole.

• Cardiac (ventricular) systole: Both AV valves (the tricuspid and the mitral) are closed by back-pressure as the ventricles are contracted and their blood volumes are ejected through the newly-opened pulmonary valve and aortic valve into the [pulmonary trunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_trunk) and aorta respectively.

![](_page_460_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 16.18** Cardiac (Ventricular) Systole. Both AV Valves lose due to backpressure as the ventricles contract. Their blood volumes are ejected through the newly opened semilunar valves (*pulmonary valve* and *aortic valve)* into the pulmonary trunk and aorta, respectively.

• Cardiac diastole: Both AV valves (tricuspid and the mitral are open to enable blood to flow directly into both left and right ventricles, where it is collected for the next contraction.

**Figure 18.1** Lymphatic System, Female.

## **Objectives:**

## **After studying this chapter, you will be able to:**

- Identify the components and anatomy of the lymphatic system.
- Describe the structure and function of the lymphatic tissue (lymph fluid, vessels, ducts, and organs)
- Describe the structure and function of the primary and secondary lymphatic organs.

# **Prelab Activities**

## **Lab Activity 18.1**

## **Definitions:**

The **primary lymphoid organs** are the bone marrow and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes proliferate and mature.

**Secondary lymphatic organs** are sites where the lymphocytes mount and adaptive response (e.g., lymphoid nodules, lymph nodes and the spleen).

## **Lymphatic System**

- Lymph node locations
  - o Cervical
  - o Axillary
  - o Inguinal
- Lymphatic vessels (general)
- Thoracic duct
  - o Cisterna chyli

- Right lymphatic duct
- Thymus
- Spleen
- Lymphatic tissue
- Tonsils (only palatine is on models

## **Lymph Node**

- Cortex contains denser nodules.
- Medulla more diffuse
- Afferent lymphatic vessel
- Efferent lymphatic vessel

**Figure 19.11** Buhl spirometer with mouthpieces.

## **Lab Activity 19.3 (Optional):**

Measuring your lung volumes

### Steps

- 1. Initial steps: Setting up the spirometer.
  - Obtain a Buhl spirometer and a mouthpiece.
  - Place the mouthpiece on the tip of the port extending out of the spirometer's body.
  - Exhale several times to practice how to use the spirometer correctly.
- 2. Measuring tidal volume (TV):
  - Set the spirometer to "0."
  - Standing , inhale normally and exhale several times to determine your normal breath pattern then when you have inhaled, exhale into the spirometer. Do not force your breath.
  - Since the spirometer begins to measure the exhaled volume at 1000ml you will have to repeat this procedure three times. After the third time record the total volume then divide that by three to obtain your average tidal volume.
- 3. Measuring expiratory reserve volume (ERV).
  - Reset the dial to "0."
  - Exhale and inhale several times using your tidal volume without measuring your exhalation.
  - Standing; at the bottom of the tidal volume, end of one cycle, place the mouthpiece of the spirometer in your mouth.
  - Exhale as much air as you can from your lungs.

- Warning: do not take an extra-large inhalation before measuring this volume, it will skew your results.
- Record the volume of this attempt.
- You need to take two more measurements. It is recommended to take a break between each measurement.
- Reset the spirometer to "0" before each measurement,
- Record the next two attempts, add all three measurements then divide by three to obtain the average expiratory reserve volume.
- 4. Measuring the vital capacity (VC):
  - Reset the spirometer to "0."
  - Breath several times using your normal tidal volume.
  - Inhale as much as you can then exhale into the spirometer all of the air that you can. Breath out as much air as you can for as long as you are able.
  - Write own your measurement and reset the spirometer to "0."
  - Take two more measurements, write down your measurements of your vital capacity after each exhalation then reset your dial to '0' after each exhalation.
- 5. Calculating the inspiratory reserve volume:
  - At this point you now have three measurements:
    - o Tidal volume
    - o Expiratory reserve volume
    - o Vital capacity
  - To obtain your inspiratory reserve (IRV)
    - o You will use the following formula Vital capacity (VC = Inspiratory capacity (IRV) = Tidal volume (TV) + expiratory reserve volume (ERV)
      - VC = IRV + TV + ERV.
    - o To calculate your Inspiratory reserve volume, you need to modify the above calculation to:
      - IRV = VC (TV + ERV)

| 6. | After calculating your data,<br>compare your values to your lab mates. |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    | a.<br>How do your values compare to the other lab members?             |
|    | b.<br>How do the female lung volumes compare with the male members?    |

**Figure 22.1** The Male Reproductive System.

# **Objectives**

In this laboratory, you will use models, diagrams, and histological samples to study the anatomy of the male reproductive system. As you study this organization, remember that a male's reproductive system is responsible for not just producing male gametes, but also transporting for these gametes to the female reproductive tract, as well as secreting the reproductive hormone testosterone.

## **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify the general functions of the male's reproductive tract.
- Identify and describe the structures and functions that contribute to the male's reproductive system. You will have to identify each in a model, diagram, or in a specimen.
- Follow the pathway taken by sperm from its site of formation to the body's exterior.
- Understand the microanatomical organization of the testis and sperm.
- List and describe the hormones regulating the production of sperm and identify their origin.
- Identify the following structural and functional components of the important structures listed below:

### **Male Reproductive System**

- Testes
  - o Seminiferous tubules
  - o Spermatozoa
  - o Scrotum

- 12. Figure 11.8. Caption: a, c) The muscles that move the humerus anteriorly are generally located on the anterior side of the body and originate from the sternum (e.g., pectoralis major) or the anterior side of the scapula (e.g., subscapularis). (b) The muscles that move the humerus superiorly generally originate from the superior surfaces of the scapula and/or the clavicle (e.g., deltoids). The muscles that move the humerus inferiorly generally originate from the middle or lower back (e.g., latissiumus dorsi). (d) The muscles that move the humerus posteriorly are generally located on the posterior side of the body and insert into the scapula (e.g., infraspinatus).
